        "\nRelease\n
        Life reminder Epic was first released was on June 6th 2016, then very few features were
        implemented (was quite primitive). Honestly the initial release had a lot of bugs. Until
        the end of July is when we started working on this final release. All thanks to the leading
        contributor, Marvel Ace who worked hard in making the app more stable and many adding advanced
        features to the apps api (Application Programming Interface). This being the final version,
        we promise you that its absolutely stable and we can predict with certainty
        that it won’t cause you any problems.
        \nDevelopers\n
        It was first developed by Frankline Sable, whilst at home during the break from the
        university and it was further developed by Marvel Ace from Nairobi university. App
        Translations was solely carried out by Haywire ledge who had recently graduated from
        High school and is currently awaiting to join collage this year.
        \nBenefits\n
        Why do you need Life Reminder? Life reminder being a task reminder, helps you manage your
        time and activities appropriately thus acts as planner, cause its enables you to schedule
        upcoming events in an easy and very user friendly way. Still it is likely to make your day
        to day activities easier and requires less effort Since it’s all about saving an event, sit
        back and relax and forget all about it, and when the time comes for that you’ll be notified
        (Trust me ノ (º _ ºノ)).
        \nFurther Details\n
        Life Reminder has been developed especially for young people (teens) in high school and
        college level, in order to help them manage their time and life activities very efficiently.
        This is because many a times, most young people have difficulty in time management and they
        are also involved in a lot of things, thus this app would come in handy as it helps them
        manage their activities more appropriately. Even though this might not be the coolest nor the
        brightest task reminder app, we promise you that it will never ever let you down, and it
        will always be there, ready to help you remember something that's critical (or nah) in your
        life ( hence: ""\"Life Reminder""\" ). \n
        The app has been tested in more than a dozens of different android devices, if you have any
        problems with the app, feel free to contact us at:
                                        lifereminder@gmail.com."

            All the world\'s a stage,\n
And all the men and women merely players;\n
They have their exits and their entrances,\n
And one man in his time plays many parts,\n
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,\n
Mewling and puking in the nurse\'s arms.\n
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel\n
And shining morning face, creeping like snail\n
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\n
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\n
Made to his mistress\' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\n
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\n
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n
Seeking the bubble reputation\n
Even in the cannon\'s mouth. And then the justice,\n
In fair round belly with good capon lined,\n
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n
Full of wise saws and modern instances;\n
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\n
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,\n
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;\n
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\n
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,\n
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\n
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\n
That ends this strange eventful history,\n
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,\n
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n
